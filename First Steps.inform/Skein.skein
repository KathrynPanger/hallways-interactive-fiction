You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, This space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops.

The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops. The Ordinary Shop is to the northeast, the Extraordinary Shop is to the northwest, and The Lonely and Dark stores are to the east and west respectively.

The main light source is a pair of florescent tubes which hum unpleasantly overhead. There are many odds and ends on the shelves: scraps of unused wall paper, cans of paste, rollers, an empty bottle of bleach, empty picture-frames, and two broken clocks. None of these seem to  be useful to you. There is also a yellowed, paint-stained sink, and in the east corner, an empty cardboard box so large that it blocks your view of the entire wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">There is something terrible about the stairs that chills you to the core. As you take your first step down, you are overcome with waves of fear and weakness. Unnameable images flash through your mind. You gasp for breath, but there is no air. Darkness consumes you as your body falls limp into the void.&#x000A;&#x000A;Walls &#x000A;You are standing on a slab of concrete that is four foot square. Around you on every side are grey brick walls that stretch upward indefinitely. Your fear resolves into a grim sense of familiarity, and a heavy burden lifts from your shoulders. You feel oddly at peace.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see the walls here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see no obvious exits.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Play House&#x000A;This house would be very cozy if it weren't sized for children. There is a kitchenette complete with a table, plastic stove and refrigerator, and a living room which contains a chair, a small throw rug, and a well-drawn picture of a television. There are many clocks drawn on the walls in crayon, each telling different times.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little plastic stove that opens and closes.&#x000A;&#x000A;A plastic refrigerator that opens and closes.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a table (on which is a plastic toaster) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go west to the Outside Room from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Here, there are five metal tanks that come up to about shoulder height. They are evenly distributed against a red brick wall. Above each tank is a pipe leading to a valve, as if to fill it. Below each tank is a second valve and pipes that lead into the floor below.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sign above the fifth tank.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see some broken glass here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The path to the south is blocked by the broken glass.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

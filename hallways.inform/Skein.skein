The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops. The Ordinary Shop is to the northeast, the Extraordinary Shop is to the northwest, and The Lonely and Dark stores are to the east and west respectively. There is also an escalator leading up to a second floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go north, south to the Lonely Room, southwest, east, west and up from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops.

Many of the doors are closed and locked, but there are two doors to your immediate left and right (east and west) that are slightly ajar, and you can see two similar doors further down the hallway. The wall paper is a rich navy and powder-blue damask pattern. Combined with the dark wooden wainscotting, it gives the hallway an unnderving air of false comfort, with vauge suggestions of austerity. &#x000A;&#x000A;You can go north, south and west to the Old Mall from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The main light source is a pair of florescent tubes which hum unpleasantly overhead. There are many odds and ends on the shelves: scraps of unused wall paper, cans of paste, rollers, an empty bottle of bleach, empty picture-frames, and two broken clocks. None of these seem to  be useful to you. There is also a yellowed, paint-stained sink, and in the east corner, an empty cardboard box so large that it blocks your view of the entire wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You notice that the floor is damp here and the linoleum warped. There must have been a disturbance recently, because a cracked can of paste has permanently glued a pile of shattered glass to the floor on the north side of the passage. Behind it is a dingy crawlspace door.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see some broken glass here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go west to the Utility Closet. The path to the north is blocked by the broken glass.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Yet More Hallway&#x000A;You are in a long hallway.  Identical doors are spaced regularly along the walls on either side.  Many of the doors are closed and locked, but there are two doors to your immediate left and right (east and west) that are slightly ajar, and you can see two similar doors further down the hallway. The wall paper is a rich navy and powder-blue damask pattern. Combined with the dark wooden wainscotting, it gives the hallway an unnderving air of false comfort, with vauge suggestions of austerity. You can see the end of the hallway to the north. &#x000A;&#x000A;You can go north, south to the Even More Hallway and west to the Old Mall from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops. The Ordinary Shop is to the northeast, the Extraordinary Shop is to the northwest, and The Lonely and Dark stores are to the east and west respectively.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Old Mall&#x000A;The hallway opens up into what appears to be an empty shopping mall. There is a high domed cieling with skylights overhead. The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops. The Ordinary Shop is to the northeast, the Extraordinary Shop is to the northwest, and The Lonely and Dark stores are to the east and west respectively. There is also an escalator leading up to a second floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go north, south, southwest, east, west to the Extraordinary Room and up from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It is reminiscent of the halls that one might see in a fancy hotel; identical doors are spaced regularly along the walls on either side, each of which are outfitted with a black box above the handle designed to accept a key card. The walls are papered with a rich navy and powder-blue damask pattern, and a tightly knitted carpet frames the passage, tracing muted grey and gold stripes down its length.  The air feels unnaturally still here.&#x000A;&#x000A;A neat section of the blue damask wall paper has torn, revealing a patch of yellow beneath it. You admire the torn piece.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see a steel knife here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go north, south, east and west to the Bedroom from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The floor transitions from the carpeted hallway to over-large tan octagonal tiles. They air is cool here and slightly more humid, as if there were a water source nearby. You think you may even hear the distant trickle of water. A few small trees can be seen in planters, spaced decoratively. In contrast to the tense and silent hallway, this space is pleasant and serene. You can see the entrance to several shops. The Ordinary Shop is to the northeast, the Extraordinary Shop is to the northwest, and The Lonely and Dark stores are to the east and west respectively.

The wood is richer and brighter, and it opens outward rather than inward. A brass plaque is posted on the wall next to it.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an unusual door and a brass plaque here.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go east and west through the unusual door (closed) from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
